# serial-access-EEPROM-memory-management-system

## ðŸ“ŒOverview
This project is a C language code file for STM32 board. The file contains functions which enables managing serial EEPROM memory chip M93C46 with MICROWIREâ„¢ standard connected to a board. A memory chip is managed by special codes sending to the STM32 board from a PC via serial termianl (eg. PuTTy). There is also the necessary configuration of USART. It is possible to manage more than one memory chip.

## Why it is useful ?
It can be used for managing any single memory chip. Thanks to this you can for eg. read content from a desoldered memory chip.

## Getting started 
You need any Nucleo F334R8 board (in the future it will be extended to any STM32 board). You can also use boards similar to F334R8. You also need a PC with serial terminal (eg. PuTTy).
Next ou have to connect somehow a memory chip to a board. Below is shown typical usage in the main function.
```c
#include "main.h"
#include "stm32f3xx.h"
#include "EEPROM_M93.h" // INCLUDING THE FILE 

EEPROM_M93_TypeDef memory1; // CREATING MEMORY OBJECT 

int main(void)
{
	memory1.GPIOAddress =  GPIOB; // SELECTING GPIO PORT WITH USED PINS
	memory1.D = 0; // PIN'S NUBER FOR DATA INTO THE MEMORY SIGNAL
	memory1.S = 1; // PIN'S NUBER FOR SELECT SIGNAL
	memory1.Q = 2; // PIN'S NUBER FOR DATA FROM THE MEMORY SIGNAL
	memory1.frequency = (uint32_t) 100000; // CLOCK FREQUENCY
	EEPROM_M93_config(&memory1); // CONFIGURATING FUNCTION 
	USART_config(); // USART CONFIGURATION FUNCTION
	while (1){
    // WAIT
	}
}
```
The screenshot below shows terminal with all of the operatins executed.
